Chaos theory is based on the course of events which are unpredictable.
The irregular and unpredictable time evolution of many non linear and complex linear systems has been named chaos.
Chaos is best illustrated by the famous [[Butterfly Effect]]


Chaos is the science of surprises, of the nonlinear and the unpredictable, It teaches us to expect the unexpected. While most traditional science deals with supposedly predictable phenomena like gravity, electricity or chemical reactions, Chaos theory deals with nonlinear things that are effectively impossible to predict or control , like turbulence, weather , the stock market, our brain states and so on .These phenomena are often described by fractal mathematics, which captures the infinite complexity of nature. Many natal objects exhibit fractal properties, including landscapes, clouds , trees, organs , rivers etc, and many of the systems in which we live exhibit complex, chaotic behaviors. Recognizing the chaotic , fractal nature of our world can give us new insight, power and wisdom.

## Properties of chaos
- The [[Butterfly Effect]] : This effect grants the power to cause a hurricane in china to a butterfly flapping its wings in New Mexico.I may take a very ling time, but the connection is real, If the butterfly had not flapped its wings at just the right point in space/time, the hurricane would not have happened. A more rigorous way to express this is that small changes in the initial condition lead to drastic change in the result. Out lines are an ongoing demonstrations of this principle,
- Unpredictability: Because we can never know all the initial conditions of a complex system in sufficient detail, we cannot hope to predict the ultimate fate of a complex system. Even slight errors in measuring the state of a system will be amplified dramatically, rendering any predication useless. Since it is impossible to measure the effects of all the butterflies (etc.) in the World, accurate long-range weather prediction will always remain impossible
- Order/ Disorder : Chaos is not simply disorder. Chaos explores the transitions between order and disorder, which often occurs in surprising ways.
- Mixing: Turbulence ensures that two adjacent points in a complex system will eventually end up in very different parts of the ocean or even in different oceans. A group of helium balloons that launch together will eventually land in drastically different places. Mixing is through because turbulence occurs at all scales. It is also nonlinear: fluids cannot be unmixed.
- Feedback: Systems often become chaotic when there is feedback present. A good example id the behaviour of stock market. As the value of a stock rises or falls, people are inclined to buy or sell that stock. This in turn further the price of the stock, causing it to rise or fall chaotically.
- Fractals: A fractal is a never-ending pattern. Fractals are self-similar across different scales. They are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback lop. Driven by recursion, fractals are images of dynamic systems- the pictures of Chaos. Geometrically, they exist in between our familiar dimensions. Fractal patterns are extremely familiar, since nature is full of fractals.

where $\delta{t}$ is the difference between the two predictions at time t and $\delta{0}$ at time zero, t is the time and a is the positive number.

Chaos theory describes the qualities of the point at which stability moves to instability or order moves to disorder. For example, unlike the behavior of a pendulum, which adheres to a predictable pattern a chaotic system does not settle into a predictable pattern due to its nonlinear processes. Examples of chaotic systems include the behavior of a waft of smoke or ocean turbulence. Chaotic systems are characteristically sensitive to initial conditions. Therefore a slight change in the initial condition could have a vast impact on the outcome, as exemplified by the ‘butterfly effect’ and in the work of meteorologist, Edward Lorenz (born in 1917).
