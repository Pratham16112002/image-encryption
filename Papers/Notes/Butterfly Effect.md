In chaos theory the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a  deterministic nonlinear system can result in large difference in a later state.

Edward Norton Lorenz noted that the butterfly effect is derives from the metaphorical example of the details of a tornado being influenced by minor perturbations such as a distant butterfly flapping its wings several weeks earlier.
He discovered the effect when he observed runs of hos weather model with initial condition data that were rounded in a seemingly inconsequential manner. He noted that the weather model would fail to reproduce the results of runs with the unbounded initial conditions data. A very small change in initial conditions had created a significantly different outcome.
The idea that small causes may have large effects in weather was earlier recognized by French mathematician engineer Henri Poincare.
The butterfly effect concept has since been used outside the context of weather science as a broad term for any situation where a small change is supposed to be the cause of larger consequences.
