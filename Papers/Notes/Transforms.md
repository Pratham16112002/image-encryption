Image transfroms are of critical importance in Chaotic image encryption.

- ## Wavelet
	THe wavelet transform is a popular method of permutating the cells of a 2D matrix and can yield a significant increase in encryption effectiveness. To fullfil the chaos requirement of good encryption, several chais sources have been paired with the wavelet transform including an improved 3D cat map, a 1D logistic map and the Arnold map and a logistic sequence . Other algorithms utilizin variations of the standard wavelet transform such as the integer Wavelet tranfrom (IWT) have also been propsed.
- ## Zigzag Transform
	The zigzag transform is capable of rearranging the cells of a 2D matric to heavily decrease the correlation between adjacent pixels, an important property when considering image encryption. Gao proposed an algorithm for image encryption utilizing a more complicated implentation of the transform that yields abetter secutity.
- ## Cosine Transform
	Zhand proposed an image encrytion algorthm utilizing the discrete Fraction cosine transform , which has additinal benefits over the standard dicscrete cosine transform that make it more suitable form image ebcyption
- ## Contourlet Transform
	The contourlet transform provides a method of decorrelating the cells of a 2D matrix and was designed to omprove upon the shortcommings of the wavelet transform when dealing with natural images.
- ## Linear Canonical Transform
	Speedy and also boasts a large keyspace to protect against brute force attakcs
