In general, cryptography is done in two ways: symmetric 
cryptography and public key cryptography. In symmetric 
cryptography, both parties - sender and receiver - use the same 
key for cryptography. The processes of encryption and 
decryption are the reverse of each other. But in public key 
cryptography, the sender encrypts the information with the 
receiver's public key, and the receiver decrypts the encrypted 
information using their private keys .

## ECIES
Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is a public key 
cryptography technique based on the algebraic structure of 
elliptic curves over finite fields that can be used to create faster, 
smaller, and more efficient cryptographic keys [14]. ECC is an 
alternative to the RSA cryptographic algorithm and is often 
used for digital signatures in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin 
and Ethereum, as well as one-way encryption of emails, data, 
and software [15]. Other uses of elliptic curves include their 
indirect use in symmetric cryptography schemes as well as in 
several integer factorization algorithms based on elliptic curves 
that have applications in cryptography [16].
