In this paper, 
- the algorithm uses a pseudo-random number sequence generated by the two-dimensional Logistic-Sine Map [[Chaos Sources#Mathematical Sources]], it is used to control a combination of some basic operations including position permutation and modulo addition.
- The information entropy of the plain image is used to build up a sensitivity mechanism of the encryption result of IEAIE on the plain image

> [!fail] Propblem
> One round of IEAIE , its three basic parts can be broken with a strategy og the divide-and conquer technique in the senario of differential attack.

Histograms are good , can be used for not so secure applications.[]
