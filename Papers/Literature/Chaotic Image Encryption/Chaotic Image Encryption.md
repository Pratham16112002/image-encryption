Paper :- [Chaotic Image Encryption](<file:///./chaotic-image-encryption-3.pdf>)

Chaos is the characteristic of a system whose current state is guaranteed to be highly sensitive to the previous state (spatial chaos), the initial conditions (temporal chaos), or both (spatio-temporal chaos). Such a sensitivity makes the output or the behavior of a chaotic system difficult to predict. Chaos  theory justifies and formulates the apparent disorder of chaotic systems on the basis of orderly patterns, structured feedback loops, iterative repetitions, self-organization, self-similarity, fractals, etc. Chaotic maps, attractors, and sequences all refer to the mathematical structures used for this formulation. Chaotic systems, maps, attractors, and sequences have been of great interest to the research community. They have been used for security purposes in a broad variety of applications ranging from smart grids to communication systems. Especially, chaotic encryption has been used for encrypting a variety of content types in addition to images.
