The dimensions of a chaos map refers to the number of functions it is composed of. Many image encryption algorithms utilize chaotic functions of varying dimensions. Chaotic functinos used in chaotic image encryption cab be categorized as follows:
- ## One-dimensional
	Wth with ine-dimensional chaos includes that by Wang and Lui, where the novel 1D Sine chaotic system weas proposed . This ystem exhibits a large parameter interval as compared to the standard sine map it was buitl upon.
	Eighandour proposed an image encrytion algorithm utilizing the 1D tent map. A similar algorithm also using the tent map was proposed by Tiwari. Extensive testing proved both algorithms to be effective at resisting common cryptographic attakcs. The former paper also elaborated on the low chaotic range for the tent map and suggested that future work use a variant with a larger raneg suchg as the tent-sine map
- ## Two-dimensional
	An image encrytion algorithm based on two-dimensional chaos was propsed by Yand and Tong . This algorithm uses the 2D logistic chaotic system and a novel block image encryption procedute. The experimental results demostrated the algorithm to have string randomness, low pixel correlations, and high key senstivity.
- ## Three-dimensional
	Many image encryption algorithms utilize three-dimensional chaos. OOne such algorithm was proposed by Qian , where they utilized the 3D logistic and cat maps. The novel usage of image reconstruction techniques also improved the effectiveness of the algorithm,
	In an algoruthm proposed by Asl, the 2D image was converted into 3 dimensional space by creating three strams from red, greenand blue channels of the image. The 3d modular choatic map was used as the chaos source for encryption
	Two other algorithms using 3D chaos systems were proposed by Cao and Fu and Xiu-chun and E-Nuo, respectively . In the former , the Rossler chaos system was used , whereas the later study opted to use the Lorenz system.
- ## Four-dimensional
	Huang proposed a novel four-dimensional chaos system based in concepts known as shape synchronization and driver-response. The complex mathematical underpinnings make the algorithm very difficult to break, and experimental tests in the application of image encryption showed promising results for its effectiveness
- ## Five-dimensional
	Zhu and Zhu proposed a novel five-dimensional chaotiv map composed of the 2D logistic and 3D discrete Lorenz map. Experimental simulations of the system when applied to image encryption resulted in high scores in many common encryption strength tests
- ## Multiple dimensional
	Work related to mixing maps of varying dimensions in image encryption has also been performed. For examples qui and Yan proposed an image encryption algorithm using both the 1D logistic map and 3D Lorenz system. Experimental results demonstrated that the algorithm has string security.
	Parida proposed a novel image encryption and transmission procedure based in Elliptic Curve cryptography. Encryption using 3D and 4D Arnold cat maps as chaos source, and the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm is utilized to establish a shared key between parties. Digital signatures allows algorithm to authenticate the encrypted message before decryption, and experimental results shows the method to be effective.
